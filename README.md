Reasoning for using Python over other langauges such as Java, etc:
- It is a language I am most comfortable with.
- It has many libraries that are well supported and documented such as: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlab for Data Science.
- There is alot more tutorials and solutions online compared to when using Java for Data Science especially.
- It is quicker to build something, although not as quick as Java, but for this project there's not much of a difference in      speed.
- 90% of data scientists use Python.

Resources used:

- https://matplotlib.org & https://seaborn.pydata.org -> very good resource to learn to make and plot onto different charts.
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/data-science-with-python-tutorial/ -> fantastic resource for 
  Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib along with Scikit-learn).
